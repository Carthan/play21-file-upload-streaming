A simple Play 2.1 application demonstrating how to stream an HTTP file upload
=============================================================================

This demo streams to a file; you could easily modify this example to stream elsewhere.

Just clone the repo and run it with Play on your local machine:
<pre>play debug run</pre>

You'll find inline comments in the code.
